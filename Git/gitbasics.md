# Git - Code Management

Git is a command-line tool for managing software projects. It is used together with GitHub in order to collaborate and manage open-source codebases. Users make branches of the master branch and then make requests for their changes to merge with the master branch.

### Basic Commands

- git branch <newbranchname>. creates a new branch
- git checkout <branchname>. moves to different branch
- git add . . adds all files in directory to branch
- git commit -m "<message>". commits branch with message
- git push -u origin <branchname>. pushes branch to remote server (ie GitHub)
- git pull. updates branch from remote server. Assumes -u flag has been set.
